# Learning_HTML_CSS_JS

1. The files in this repository are my practice files.
2. For the same purpose, I have also created this repository.
3. I have also referred various resources online, which I'll put up in detail sometime down the line, in this README file.
4. Currently, I have referred some videos from the Free Code Camp YouTube playlist on Learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
5. All images are sourced online. 

# To whosoever it may concern, if you are learning any of the above, please do not refer the files in this repository.
